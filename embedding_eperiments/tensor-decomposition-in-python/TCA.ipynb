In line with these objectives, we will implement tensor decomposition using two libraries available in Python ([TensorLy](http://tensorly.org/stable/index.html) and [tensortools](https://tensortools-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and a simple implementation of Tensor Decomposition with Numpy (via alternating optimization). Furthermore, the result of these three approaches are compared in terms of reconstruction error and execution time.\n",
